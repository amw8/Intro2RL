\textbf{Challenge Problem:} Suppose we have a continuing MDP with a discount factor $\gamma$.
Now suppose you have an identical MDP without a discount factor except we
now have a termination probability $1-\gamma, 0 \leq \gamma <1$, at each
time step.
This implies that for any given state $S_t$ at time $t$, independent of which action
the agent takes there's a $1-\gamma$ probability that the MDP terminates 
\textit{after}
the agent collects reward $R_{t+1}$.
Show that the expected cumulative reward at time $t$ is the same for both
MDPs, that is for the second MDP we have the following
\[
	E[G_t] = E[R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}\gamma + R_{t+3}\gamma^2 +\dots].
\]

Hint: Recall the law of total expectation (tower property)
$E\left[E\left[X|Y\right]\right]$. Consider conditioning on the random
variable $T$, the number of time steps before termination.
Also note that $T$ follows the geometric distribution where
$P(T=s) = \gamma^{s-1}(1-\gamma)$.
