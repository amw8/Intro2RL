An agent observes the following two episodes from an MDP,
\[
S_0 = 0, A_0 = 1, R_1 = 1, S_1 = 1, A_1= 1, R_2 = 1
\]
\[
S_0 = 0, A_0 = 0, R_1 = 0, S_1 = 0, A_1= 1, R_2 = 1, S_2 = 1, A_2=1, R_{3} = 1
\]
and updates its deterministic model accordingly. What would the model output for the following queries:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\text{Model}(S = 0, A = 0)$:
  \item $\text{Model}(S = 0, A = 1)$:
  \item $\text{Model}(S = 1, A = 0)$:
  \item $\text{Model}(S = 1, A = 1)$:
\end{enumerate}
