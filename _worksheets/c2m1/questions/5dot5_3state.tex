Consider the three state MDP below with terminal state $T_{3 }$ and $\gamma=1$.
Suppose you observe three episodes: $\{S_{0}, S_{1} , T_{3}\}$ with a return of 2, $\{S_{0}, S_{1} , T_{3}\}$ with a return of 2, $\{S_{0}, S_{2} , T_{3}\}$ with a return of 1.
What is the (every-visit) Monte-carlo estimator of the value for each of state $S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}$?
How would the Monte-Carlo estimates change if $r(S_{0}, A_{1}, S_{1}) = +1.00$?
