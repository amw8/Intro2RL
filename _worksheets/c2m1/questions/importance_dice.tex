Suppose you would like to estimate the expected outcome for 
$3X^2$ where $X$ is the outcome of a fair die. 
You run an experiment and observe the following sequence of rolls
\[
	1,1,6,3,4.
\]
How would you use the above data to estimate the expected value 
$\mathbb{E}[3X^2]$ for a fair die if the above rolls where observed 
from a loaded die with $P(X=1) = 1/2$ and $P(X=i)=1/10$ for $i=2,3,4,5,6$?


%%% ANSWERS %%%%%
%   0.1666/0.5*(1+1) + 0.1666/0.1*(6^2+3^2+4^2) = 102.333 => estimate = 61.4
