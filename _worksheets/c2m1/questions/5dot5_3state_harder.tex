Consider the three state MDP from question $5$, but let $r(S_1, A_1,T_{3}) = +1.00$ and $r( S_{2}, A_{0},T_{3})=+2.00$.
You observe the following episodes:
$\{S_{0}, S_{1} , T_{3}\}$ with a return of 2, $\{S_{0}, S_{1} , T_{3}\}$ with a return of 2, $\{S_{0}, S_{1} , T_{3}\}$ with a return of 1, $\{S_{0}, S_{2} , T_{3}\}$ with a return of 1.
What is the (every-visit) Monte-carlo estimator of the value for each of state $S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}$?
