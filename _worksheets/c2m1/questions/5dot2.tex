(\textit{Exercise 5.2 S\&B}) Suppose every-visit MC was used instead of 
first-visit MC on the blackjack task. Would you expect the results to be very
different? Why or why not?

%%%ANSWER%%%%
% The state depends on three variables, 
% 1) player's current sum
% 2) dealer's card
% 3) whether the player holds a usable ace
% this implies that the same state will not be visited more than
% once in an episode and first-visit will be the same as every-visit MC.
