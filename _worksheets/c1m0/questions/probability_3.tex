Suppose you start a betting game with $\$5000$ and roll a 6 sided die 100 times. Before any dice rolls however, you must decide on a proportion of your wealth to be wagered for each dice roll. If the die shows 1 or 2, you will lose $12\%$ of your wager. If the die shows 3, 4, 5 or 6 you will win $10\%$ of your wager.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item What is a good proportion to bet?
    \item How much are you expected to win with this proportion?
    \item What is the probability of you losing over $50\%$ of your wealth by the end of the game?
    \item What is the probability of you losing any money at all?
\end{enumerate}
