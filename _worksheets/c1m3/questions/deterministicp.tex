A deterministic policy $\pi(s)$ outputs an action $a \in \mathcal{A} = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\}$ directly. More generally, a policy $\pi(\cdot | s)$ outputs the probabilities for all actions: $\pi(\cdot | s) = [\pi(a_1 | s), \pi(a_2 | s), \ldots, \pi(a_k | s)]$. How can you write a deterministic policy in this form? Let $\pi(s) = a_i$ and define $\pi(\cdot | s)$.
