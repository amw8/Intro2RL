(\textit{Exercise 4.1 S\&B)}
Consider the 4x4 gridworld below, where actions that
would take the agent off the grid leave the state unchanged.
The task is episodic with $\gamma =1$ and the terminal states are the
shaded blocks.
Using the precomputed values for the equiprobable policy below,
what is $q_\pi(11,\mbox{down})$?
What is $q_{\pi}(7,\mbox{down})$?
