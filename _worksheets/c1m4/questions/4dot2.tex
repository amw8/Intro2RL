(\textit{Exercise 4.2 from S\&B})
Suppose in the above gridworld where a new state 15 is added to the gridworld just below state 13, and its actions, left, up, right, and dowm, take the agent
to the states 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively. Assume that the transitions from
the original states are unchanged. What, then is, $v_\pi(15)$ for the equiprobable random policy? Now suppose the dynamics of state 13 are also changed, such that
action down from state 13 takes the agent to the new state 15. What is $v_\pi(15)$ for the equiprobable random policy in this case?
