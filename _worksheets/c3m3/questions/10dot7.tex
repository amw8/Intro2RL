(\textit{Exercise 10.7 S\&B})
Consider a Markov reward process consisting of a ring of three states A, B,
and C, with state transitions going deterministically around the ring.
A reward of $+1$ is received upon arrival in A and otherwise the reward is $0$.
What are the differential values of the three states using
$$ v_{\pi} = \underset{\gamma \rightarrow 1}{\lim}\,\, \underset{h \rightarrow \infty}{\lim} \sum_{t=0}^{h} \gamma^{t}\left(  \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [R_{t+1} | S_{0} = s] - r(\pi)\right)$$
