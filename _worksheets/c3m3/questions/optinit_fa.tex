How would you use optimistic initial values, for Sarsa with a tile coding function approximator? Assume you have a two dimensional input, and you use $m$ tilings, and $n$ tiles, to give $m$ grids of size $n \times n$ resulting in $m \times n \times n$ features. What size is your weight vector? And how do you initialize your weights to ensure you have optimistic initial values? Assume the maximum reward is $R_\text{max}$ and we use a $\gamma < 1$.
